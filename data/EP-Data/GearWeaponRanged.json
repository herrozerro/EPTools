Additional shots can be used to apply more layers to a trapped target (each requiring a SOM Check to break free). The foam allows characters to breathe even if their mouth and nose are covered, but it may impede sight. Freezer foam can be spiked with contact toxins or drugs to additionally incapacitate the target.
