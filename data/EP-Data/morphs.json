Ripwings take advantage of the chiroptera genestock used to give the first avian uplifts functional hands. Instead of feathers, they feature tough leathery skin or even scales.

The primary modification made to the original creature was to turn the entire organism upside down and orient the digestive portion of the organism horizontally, so that the whiplash\u2019s tri-lobed orifice faces forward. The whiplash\u2019s grasping roots were also converted into even more motile \u201Cwalking tentacles.\u201D Other adjustments include the addition of a pair of grasping limbs, each with four universally opposable digits; artificial sensing mods (providing transhuman-standard sensing ability); and a general toughening of the internal structure for rigidity and support. The ability to extend and retract the whiplash\u2019s feeding tendril was heavily enhanced, so now the tendril acts more like a two-meter-long chameleon-like tongue than a hanging food-trap.",

Most importantly, they are built without cortical stacks, so if they are destroyed, the ego cannot be interrogated through psychosurgery. Griefers are illegal in many habitats, especially in the Planetary Consortium, but DRM-free blueprints are easy to find in many darknets, thus making them a persistent annoyance across the Solar System. A few habitats have passed laws mandating that destroying a griefer is not considered murder, assault, or even destruction of property.",
