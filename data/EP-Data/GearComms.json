These devices mesh with each other and other devices, allowing you to map your position in relation to the breadcrumb trail, and creating a mesh connection all the way back to the trail’s source. This is for tracking your movement, finding your way back, and keeping meshed with your camp or ship in derelict habitats, wilderness, and other areas where there is no local functioning mesh.</p>",

Because it is exceptionally safe and secure, quantum farcasting via neutrino communications is the primary means of both long-distance communication between habitats and egocasting.
