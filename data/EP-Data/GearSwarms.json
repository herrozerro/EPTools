Covert operatives and criminals use cleaners to eliminate potential forensic evidence, such as blood, hair, or anything that could be DNA-typed.</p>",

    "Description": "<p>Also known as smart corrosives, these nanobots break down matter. They can be programmed to take apart specific materials while ignoring others, leaving them intact. They are sometimes used as an anti-matériel weapon, eating away at synthmorphs, weapons, and gear while ignoring biomorphs (or vice versa). Upon contact, disassemblers inflict DV 1d6 per action turn. Accumulated damage counts as a wound when your Wound Threshold is reached. Worn armor (both energy and kinetic) protects against this damage (unless the swarm is programmed to ignore it), but is also eaten away; reduce the AV by the damage inflicted, splitting it between armor types (i.e., a disassembler inflicting DV 2 turns AV 4/2 into 3/1).</p>",

A fixer swarm repairs 1d10 [6] damage per hour. Once all damage is repaired, it will restore 1 wound per day. Fixers also clean and polish items, returning them to a new, pristine state. Fixer swarms cannot effect repairs on objects with more than 3 wounds, but they will apply a +30 modifier to Hardware Tests for repair.</p>",

Guardians can be programmed or instructed to release captured mites, allowing you to temporarily disable a swarm and then release it afterwards.</p>",

Pusher swarms can be programmed to seek out specific people, biomorphs or animals of a certain type, or all living things. A biological target who comes into contact with a pusher swarm is automatically exposed to the effect of the carried drug or toxin. Pushers cannot penetrate vacsuits, but they can linger on the exterior long enough to target the occupant when they remove it. Each swarm carries enough to affect 5 targets.</p>",

Once an object is exposed, the saboteurs have a 50% chance of inflicting a wound (and the equivalent DV) every (Wound Threshold) action turns. This will continue until the target has suffered 5 wounds and is incapacitated. Armor has no effect, but the wounds can be repaired as normal. Saboteurs cannot sabotage other nanoswarms.</p>",
