Apply a +10 modifier to Infiltrate Tests, +30 if stationary and completely covered. Chameleon cloaks are not effective against radar, x-ray, or gamma-ray sensors. They do hide you from thermal infrared, however, by absorbing body heat into a heat sink. The cloak can only absorb body heat for one hour before it must emit this heat. Heat emission also requires one hour, during which time you are easily visible in the thermal infrared spectrum.</p>",

It contains smart matter micromanipulators, cutting tools, and an advanced nanotechnology generator capable of producing nanobots that can bore or cut through almost any material and infiltrate the inner workings of electronic locks to disable or open them.</p><p> Cutting out a lock/bolt or boring a 10-centimeter-diameter hole in a wall with a COT requires (Wound Threshold ÷ 5) action turns. The COT’s nanobots can repair this damage so that it is invisible to any but the most careful and detailed examination. Cutting out a larger, 1-meter diameter hole in a wall requires (Wound Threshold ÷ 10) minutes and cannot be repaired.</p><p> A COT can easily open any old-fashioned mechanical lock simply by analyzing it and shaping an appropriate key, though this takes a full action turn.</p><p> The tool’s nanobots can also circumvent the security of electronic locks. Make a test using the COT’s Hardware: Electronics 60. This is a task action with a timeframe of 4 action turns, whether opening or disabling the lock. On a superior/critical failure, an alarm is triggered. On a critical success, the opening is not logged. If the electronic lock is protected by a guardian nanoswarm, the COT has a 60% chance of opening the lock before its nanobots are disabled.</p>",

    "Description": "<p>This cloak is made of metamaterials with a negative refractive index, so that light actually bends around it, making it and anything it covers invisible (-60 to Perceive, -30 to target with a 50% miss chance in combat). This invisibility works from the microwave to ultraviolet frequencies, but not against radar or x-rays. The drawback is that anything concealed within the cloak can’t see out. This is easily overcome by using external sensor feeds (if available) and entoptics to navigate. Alternatively, a small piece of anti-cloak, which cancels the cloak’s invisibility properties when touched together, can be used to create a small window to peep out of, though this increases the chance of being spotted. Noticing such a window requires a Perceive Test with a -30 modifier.</p>",
