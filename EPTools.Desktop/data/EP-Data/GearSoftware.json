They can also plot maps based on sensory input, positioning systems, and other data.</li><li>Positioning: Tacnets indicate the position of known people, bots, vehicles, and other features according to sensory input or their calculated trajectories. Friend-or-foe tags highlight allies and opponents, noting their lines of sight and fields of fire and alerting the user to areas of potential cover or danger.</li><li>Sensory Input: Tacnets share all sensory input available from members and linked devices. This includes data from physical senses, portable sensors, smartlink guncams, XP feeds, etc. Users can immediately call up and access the sensor feeds of others as needed.</li><li>Communications Management: Tacnets maintain an encrypted VPN between users. They actively monitor for dropped signals and hacking/sniffing/jamming attempts. Treat as Infosec 40.</li><li>Smartlink/Weapon Data: Tacnets monitor the status of weapons, accessories, and other gear, bringing damage, shortages, ammo counts, and other issues to the user’s attention.</li><li>Medical Data: Tacnets monitor the health of their users via medichines, implants, and other sensors. Users can call up health reports on their allies.</li><li>Overwatch: Tacnets keep an eye out for potential threats. They provide a +10 modifier to Perceive Tests against surprise ▶227.</li><li>Indirect Fire: Members of a tacnet can provide targeting data to each other for purposes of indirect fire ▶206.</li><li>Analysis: Tacnets can analyze real-time situations to provide suggestions and warnings. The app's god’s-eye view of a situation helps it to identify facts and details that individuals overlook. For example, a tacnet can analyze an opposing team's weapons, shots fired, and potential injuries and suggest tactical maneuvers. Querying a tacnet for advice is a quick action; treat as Know: Tactics 80.</li></ul><p>Many tacnet features are immediately accessible to the user via their AR display; other data can be accessed with a quick action. The GM determines when the tacnet provides important alerts to the user. At the GM’s discretion, some of these features may apply modifiers to the character’s tests. Tacnets are designed to be overseers, not to take action. They will not hack opponents, pilot vehicles, or interface with weapon systems.</p>",
