Ariel morphs have exotic-looking heads similar to those of hulder morphs, but they also possess sleek and streamlined humanoid bodies with four limbs and a pair of bat-like wings.

Based on simple splicers, freeman morphs are genetically and psychosurgically modified to be receptive to authority while weakening willpower and \u201Cdissident\u201D traits. They are also genetically modified with a protein that makes their neurons sensitive to light. When combined with an optogenetics module, these neurons can be activated and deactivated remotely, enabling a monitoring muse or meshed overseer to control the ego\u2019s behavior. Freeman morphs typically carry a monitor ALI (often a modified fork of the dictator\u2019s muse) that watches over the ego, reports suspicious activity, and can seize physical control in an emergency. In some regimes, citizens are not informed of these implants, enabling the AIs to spy and snitch in secret. These \u201Cslave morphs\u201D are decried or outlawed as coercive in many polities, though they are secretly deployed in remote corporate and authoritarian habitats.

Some people find neotenic sleeves distasteful, especially when employed in certain media and sex work capacities, but most are designed to be neuter-gendered.",

Many primate uplifts choose hypergibbons when they need something small like a neotenic. Built from siamang genestock, the largest of the lesser apes, hypergibbons stand about 1 meter tall, weigh 15 kilograms, and typically have black fur and skin (although bodysculpting permits many variations). They have inflatable throat sacks that allow melodious calls that carry great distances. Their wrists feature a ball-and-socket joint and also naturally dislocate to enable easier swinging by the arms.",

Ripwings take advantage of the chiroptera genestock used to give the first avian uplifts functional hands. Instead of feathers, they feature tough leathery skin or even scales. Most ripwings have a uniform matte black skin coloration, though they are able to change color at will.",

The primary modification made to the original creature was to turn the entire organism upside down and orient the digestive portion of the organism horizontally, so that the whiplash\u2019s tri-lobed orifice faces forward. The whiplash\u2019s grasping roots were also converted into even more motile \u201Cwalking tentacles.\u201D Other adjustments include the addition of a pair of grasping limbs, each with four universally opposable digits; artificial sensing mods (providing transhuman-standard sensing ability); and a general toughening of the internal structure for rigidity and support. The ability to extend and retract the whiplash\u2019s feeding tendril was heavily enhanced, so now the tendril acts more like a two-meter-long chameleon-like tongue than a hanging food-trap.",

Griefers have embedded sound and holographic display systems to make their presence known. They are often equipped with hacking tools and other subversive ware, from graffiti implements and mounted sprayers to nanoswarm hives or even explosives, according to their specific purpose. Most importantly, they are built without cortical stacks, so if they are destroyed, the ego cannot be interrogated through psychosurgery. Griefers are illegal in many habitats, especially in the Planetary Consortium, but DRM-free blueprints are easy to find in many darknets, thus making them a persistent annoyance across the Solar System. A few habitats have passed laws mandating that destroying a griefer is not considered murder, assault, or even destruction of property.",
