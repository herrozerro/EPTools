    "Description": "<p>Healing vats may be the most powerful medical devices in common use. Vats preserve biomorphs in nutrient gel crawling with medical nanobots, while injection lines pump the body full of medichine swarms. They quickly assess your health, mend bones, heal wounds, regenerate limbs, and otherwise repair your biological form (Healing & Repair ▶221). With the exception of a few exceptionally deadly nanoplagues and certain kinds of neurological damage, a healing vat can cure any disease and heal any injury. As long as you are alive when you are placed in the healing vat, you will not only survive, but emerge without a scratch, given enough time. A healing vat can even take your severed head (as long as it has been stabilized by medichines or nanotech first aid) and regrow an entire body based on your head’s genetics.</p><p>Medical care is not all that healing vats are used for — they are also the safest way to sculpt your body or install various bioware, cyberware, and nanoware systems. Specialized nanomachines are used to grow the ware inside your body or otherwise customize your form. Every hospital, clinic, body bank, chop shop, and augmentation parlor has several healing vats.</p>",

It also provides vital signs and an analysis of the person’s overall health.

Given that nanobots are so tiny, the density of nanobots in the area has a large impact on its success. The nanodetector has Exotic Skill: Nanobot Detection 40 for detecting nanobots, +30 if an active nanoswarm or hive is present. Nanodetectors often pick up expired nanobots from swarms no longer active, but they can assess whether the bots are still active (or were recently) and the rough density (Durability) of the swarm in the area. Once a nanobot is detected it can be analyzed either by the user or the nanodetector’s AI, using Know: Nanotechnology 60 skill. Nanodetectors are often worn and left on, set to alert you if a hostile nanoswarm is detected.</p>",
