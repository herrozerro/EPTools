    "Description": "<p>This miniature plasma sail can operate for three months thanks to a potent battery-powered superconducting magnet and a tank holding sufficient compressed hydrogen. With this, you can use the solar wind to accelerate up to 0.01 g through open space to a maximum velocity of 80 kilometers per second away from the sun (slower if you tack in other directions; the wind is too faint to provide acceleration past Saturn). You can also maneuver freely within the proximity of a planet’s magnetic field (ranging from within 70,000 kilometers of Earth to 3,000,000 kilometers of Jupiter). You can also land on or take off from any moon or heavenly body with a surface gravity less than 0.05 g. This implant is large and produces a characteristic humpback shape on most morphs. Use Pilot: Space skill with a Movement Rate of very fast (8/40).</p>",

For synthmorphs, this means protective laminate layers and shielding of sensitive electronics. For biomorphs, this means implanted shielding for vital organs, blood filters, and redundant encoding of DNA. The bioware version requires medichines, which handle rapid replacement of damaged tissues. Exact radiation effects are determined by the GM. This ware has limited effectiveness against extreme radiation sources such as Jupiter’s electromagnetic field, especially over a prolonged period.</p>",
